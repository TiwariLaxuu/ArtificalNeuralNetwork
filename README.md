# ArtificalNeuralNetwork
An artificial neural network (ANN) is the piece of a computing system designed to simulate the way the human brain analyzes and processes 
information. It is the foundation of artificial intelligence (AI) and solves problems that would prove impossible or difficult by human 
or statistical standards. Artificial Neural Network(ANN) uses the processing of the brain as a basis to develop algorithms that can be 
used to model complex patterns and prediction problems.
